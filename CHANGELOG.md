## [1.0.1] -- 21/04/2020

* Minor changes to code formatting

## [1.0.0] - 21/04/2020

* I did a massive overhaul so that the data transferred is a packet object rather then just a string. This allows the information of each packet to be read (e.g host, port, name of user packet from). On top of this you can also give packets names. This means you can send mutliple types of data as a payload (be wary that the data may be converted into String upon arrival). 
* Feel free to leave feedback (or even contribute :grin: )on my Github as this is still a work in progress.

## [0.1.1] - 20/04/2020

* The package now has a reasonable length description.

## [0.1.0] - 20/04/2020

* The package has been created. It's still going to be unstable as many of the features haven't yet been tested.
* Thank the creator of Node Commander as he is the real one behind all this
